You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd name-of-new-app
   ```

4. Copy and rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   API_URL=https://esp-back.fly.dev/
   JWT_SECRET=[YOUR JWT SECRET]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

# Run app with docker

Build an image with the following command:

```sh
docker build -t esp_front .
```
And run the app:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env -v $(pwd):/app esp_front
```

# Test the app with Cypress

1. Run the app locally

    ```sh
      bun run dev
    ```
2. Copy and rename `cypress.env.example.json` to  `cypress.env.json` and update the test data.

3. Run cypress directly in a browser:
```sh
  bun run cy:open
```
